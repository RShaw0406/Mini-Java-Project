Introduction 

 

Good Thirteen is a simple, single-player card game that uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards.  The object of the game is to remove all 52 cards from the playing area by matching them in one of 2 ways as follows: 

by removing a pair of cards for which the combined rank value is 13 regardless of their suit.  The rank value of an Ace is 1 and cards from 2-10 take the rank value of their number.  In addition, the Jack scores eleven, the Queen twelve and the King thirteen  
 

by removing individual Kings which are the only cards having a value of 13. 

 

The game begins by dealing 10 cards from a shuffled deck, so that the cards are face-up (i.e. the values of the cards are visible).  The player examines the 10 cards and, if one or two cards can be seen that satisfy either of the removal conditions above, those cards can be removed.  As cards are removed, they are replaced by cards from the remainder of the deck, for as long as the deck has cards remaining. 

 

The game is won when all 52 cards are removed from the game.  If a stalemate is reached where neither of the conditions for removal can be satisfied, then the game is lost. The rules of the game can be seen online at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Thirteen. 

 

The application will be a pure text version – with keyboard input.  The program must employ a console interface only.  

 

Required Functionality 

 

There are 6 levels to which the submission can be completed – attracting increasing rewards. 

 

1. The facilities to create a new game are present and the game can be set up in its initial state, with 10 cards dealt face-up from a shuffled deck. 

2. The basic game mechanism is in place.  Users can select legal combinations of cards to be removed and they are replaced by new cards dealt from the deck (for as long as the deck has cards available). 

3. A full playable game is available.  The application is able to prompt the player when the game is won (all cards removed) or lost (stalemate is reached as no cards can be removed). 

4. The game is able to provide a hint to the player (on request) suggesting a valid move or confirming that no move is possible. 

5. On completion of a game (whether the player has won or lost) the application is able to replay the game move by move, with the user prompting each replayed move by a keypress. 

6. The application is able to play a complete game in “demonstration mode”, where the only input from the player is to prompt the application to play its next move.  The computer should provide a commentary on each move made such as “5 of Spades and 8 of Diamonds removed”, “King of Club removed” and so on.
